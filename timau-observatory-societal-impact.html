										<h1>Societal Impacts of  <br />Timau National
										Observatory, Indonesia: <br />An Exploratory Study</h1>

									<p>
									A science institution impacts far beyond the science field. 
									It is also part of the community. 
									It needs the community to stay in operation. 
									It becomes clear that the impacts reach the community as well. 
									Therefore, understanding societal impacts is crucial in the operational preparation of a science institute. </p>
									
									<p>My research looked into the societal impacts of Indonesia's Timau National Observatory (TNO). 
									TNO is the government's dedication towards developing national astronomy research, ensuring dark skies for high-quality observations. 
									Interestingly, TNO is located in East Nusa Tenggara province, one of the country's poor provinces. 
									Societal impacts from TNO are worth investigating.</p>
																		
									<p>I interviewed several people online to collect information. 
									These people represented various TNO stakeholders: astronomers, government, and locals. 
									I used ATLAS.ti to categorize their answers into themes. 
									As a result, I came up with three themes. 
									Firstly, the expectations and realized contributions towards society. 
									Secondly, TNO's community engagement. 
									Lastly, how TNO will operate. </p>
									
									<p>I divided the first theme into three subthemes. 
									The first one shows how the community expects an economic boost because of TNO. 
									There are two main factors contributing to this expectation. 
									Firstly, TNO can increase tourism. Secondly, TNO opens new vacancies. 
									There is hope for TNO to employ locals, including as researchers. 
									Employing locals increases their pride. 
									After all, they are proud that their region was chosen for TNO's site.  </p>
									
									<p>However, an economic boost, especially regarding tourism, might turn into a boomerang for TNO. 
									Without proper lighting regulations, tourism increase will introduce light pollution. 
									If that is the future, TNO will lose its full potential. 
									To solve this issue, tourism can shift to astro-tourism. 
									Combining it with ethno-tourism and eco-tourism will transform local tourism into something unique, highlighting local cultures while also promoting the protection of the night sky. </p>
									
									<p>The second subtheme discusses how TNO promotes better infrastructure. 
									On the one side, TNO needs good infrastructure to support its operation. 
									On the other side, the region's bad infrastructure isolates them and slows down the local economy. 
									Ever since TNO construction began, the region has seen more positive effects from better infrastructure. </p> 
									
									<p>Three points of view emerge regarding this subtheme. 
									Firstly, TNO is the cause of infrastructure improvements. 
									From this point of view, people believe no improvements would have been made whatsoever if it was not because of TNO. 
									Secondly, infrastructure improvements are the side effects of TNO. 
									The initial focus is just to support TNO. 
									The improvements locals acquire are merely because TNO needs them. 
									The last point of view argues that TNO quickens infrastructure improvements. 
									Plans for improvements were already there. 
									Therefore, even without TNO, improvements will still be made, albeit at a much slower pace.  </p>
									
									<p>The last subtheme dives into the hopes for better education. 
									News about TNO has already sparked interest among locals. 
									They are curious about this new institution and what it will do. 
									This curiosity has been reflected in the younger minds. 
									More students are excited to enrol for high school since news about the government opening a new high school with a space-related curriculum spread out. 
									There is an indication that parents also push their children to obtain higher degrees for a better future. 
									In addition, better education trains young researchers who may take over future TNO operations. </p>
									
									<p>Despite the positive reception within the field of education, several obstacles stand in contrast. 
									Most schools have poor infrastructure. 
									Even worse, the supposedly high school with a space-related curriculum has never had such a curriculum. 
									The latter leaves a great disappointment among enrolled students. </p>
									
									<p>Two solutions have been proposed to tackle these obstacles. 
									Constructing the needed space-related curriculum is a priority if the government is serious about opening that high school. 
									The curriculum guarantees the preparation towards graduating students with sufficient knowledge in astronomy. 
									The preparation will help TNO to sustain its research and operation in return. 
									The other solution is building a science centre. 
									The centre will not only fulfil people's curiosity. 
									It will ease the burden for TNO to accept visitations as well. 
									Regarding whether the plan for the science centre still moves forward, establishing cooperation with private funders may be an alternative to secure the plan fund.</p>
									
									<p>With the second theme, there are hopes for TNO to always involve the community. 
									Involvements come in many ways, such as opening vacancies, holding open sessions to discuss issues, and pushing for better education. 
									However, community involvement is not straightforward. 
									Discussions are sometimes complicated due to local elders' influence on the majority's decisions. 
									Poverty also plays a part. 
									It discourages people from accepting information without expecting any rewards.</p>
																	
									<p>Addressing the problems requires different approaches. 
									People's curiosity is a factor to maximize. 
									TNO can initialize engagement by organizing informal learning sessions. 
									For schools, these can be small space-related projects. 
									Casual talks, seminars, and workshops are better for the general public. 
									TNO may invite local organizations to cooperate and protect nature and culture. </p>	

									<p>The last theme is more directed towards policymakers and organizations which will operate TNO. 
									One major issue is the complicated and slow bureaucracy within each related organization. 
									TNO needs clear regulations to protect itself from future threats, such as light pollution, and to operate smoothly. 
									These regulations must also be strictly implemented.</p>
									
									<p>Finally, I constructed a communication plan for TNO based on the results I found. 
									This guideline consists of recommendations for TNO to follow. 
									The main goal is to provide TNO with a guideline to mitigate and solve current and future threats and problems. 
									Even though not everything might be applicable based on forthcoming situations, at the very least they can serve as initial solutions. 
									All in all, consulting the communication plan may help with building better communication among stakeholders. 
									In return, the effort will pay off by establishing sustainable stakeholder relationships and meeting all side's expectations.
