										<h1>ASASSN-21js: A Multi-Year Transit of a Ringed Disc</h1>

									</span>
									
									<p>Every other star dims and brightens. 
									These are called variable stars. 
									Some return to their original brightness in hours. 
									Others need weeks or even months. 
									Many things can cause dimming, from stellar spots to exoplanet transits. 
									Some causes are understood better than others. 
									Whatever they may be, astronomers try their best to find out. </p>
									
									<p>Enter ASASSN-21js. 
									In 2021, this southern star had its brightness suddenly plunged. 
									It reached rock bottom at 80% of its original flux (or brightness) in only 10 months. 
									Then, it rapidly brightened before the rate dropped considerably. 
									To this date, it is still slowly yet steadily brightening. 
									Thus, ASASSN-21js' light curve is unique as it is unfinished, more than 2 years since the dim started. </p>
																		
									<p>As a whole, this star is quite peculiar. 
									It did not show any variability before 2021, at least as far back as observations go for this star. 
									Its light curve is asymmetrical. 
									And the star seems to brighten 'reluctantly'. 
									One question hovers above all these: what causes ASASSN-21js to dim? </p>
									
									<p>My master's research aimed to answer that question with the best possible explanation. 
									I used Python to run various scenarios to recreate the light curve. 
									Once there was a match, I ran similar scenarios with slightly varied parameters. 
									The reran would cover different situations on how the dimming event might end. 
									The overall outcome could help constrain and test the proposed scenario. </p>
									
									<p>The dimming event is likely not caused by the star due to its length. 
									Something must have moved before the star, blocking its light. 
									This process, called a transit, may involve a variety of objects, from exoplanets to dusty blobs. 
									An asymmetrical light curve eliminated an exoplanet transit and spherical dust blob. 
									The next logical explanation would be a transiting secondary body with a disc/ring system. 
									The rest of my research focused on this scenario.</p>
									
									<p>I utilized Prof Matthew Kenworthy's <a href="https://github.com/mkenworthy/exorings">exorings3</a> package to build the disc/ring system. 
									In the beginning, I tried three models. 
									The first was two concentric discs, the larger being more translucent than the smaller. 
									The second was a reverse of the first approach. 
									The third was making the smaller disc translucent, creating a ring system. 
									The last approach turned out capable of recreating the deep dip. 
									Hence, I proceeded with it. </p> 
									
									<p>Upon further investigation, the dip seems to happen in two stages. 
									The first happened around one year before the plunge. 
									This dip only lowered the star's flux by around 1 per cent. 
									The shallow dip may hint at a second outer ring that is more translucent than the inner. 
									My further models would then use this configuration. </p>
									
									<p>While recreating the light curve with different ring system parameters, some models support the existence of a gap. 
									The gap, albeit narrow in comparison with the radius of the system, is intriguing. 
									A gap may sign at a small body clearing debris from what was previously a single disc, like an exomoon. 
									Whether a gap truly exists or not is open for further discussion. </p>
									
									<p>The results of the model runs are fascinating. 
									The average ring system radius measures 2.3 au while the inner ring's radius spans 1.5 au, roughly a Sun-Mars distance. 
									Rings this size are rare, assuming the owner is a celestial body less massive than ASASSN-21js. 
									Two other star systems with similarly ringed companions are J1407 and PDS 110. </p>
									
									<p>The 'steep' flux drop corresponds to a transversal velocity of only around 0.6 km/s. 
									Even Pluto orbits the Sun almost 8 times faster. 
									Assuming ASASSN-21js' companion has a circular orbit, it will be around 12000 au away from the star. 
									In our Solar System scale, the companion would become an Oort Cloud inhabitant. 
									There are a few very widely separated star-planet systems known so far. 
									The widest is COCONUTS 2 and 2b with a 6000 au separation.  </p>
									
									<p>Deciding if this model is the truth remains an open question. 
									Modelling ASASSN-21js' SED suggests the star is an A-type star, around 4.5 times more massive than the Sun. 
									This information suggests ASASSN-21js' companion to be gravitationally bound to its star. 
									Still, stars with such a high mass are rare. 
									Therefore, the odds of observing one similar to ASASS-21js will be extremely low, less than half a per cent per 60 million stars ASASSN observes. </p>
																	
									<p>Overall, ASASSN-21js is a unique system. 
									Whether the exact cause will become clear needs a complete light curve. 
									If the current model holds, the transit will end by 2027. 
									Thus, there is still enough time to do follow-up observations. 
									Any chance of observing in wavelengths other than visual (ASASSN's main filter band) will become a great opportunity. 
									With the aid of multiwavelength data, it will be possible to derive other ring characteristics, such as grain size. </p>
