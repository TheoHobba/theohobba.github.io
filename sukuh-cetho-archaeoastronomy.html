										<h1>Archaeoastronomy of <br />
										Sukuh and Cetho Temples, Central Java</h1>

									<p>In the past, several Hindi and Buddhist kingdoms flourished where Indonesia today stands. 
									One of the hard evidence left to tell their long-lost existence is the ancient temples scattered throughout Java and Sumatra. 
									Interest sparked in the early millennia to investigate if those temples contained astronomical concepts. 
									This interest is not without solid grounds since researchers have known that past civilizations had established strong relationships with the sky.</p>

									<p>Ancient temples can showcase astronomical concepts through their architecture. However, these concepts are usually not immediately apparent. 
									The advent of archaeoastronomy, where astronomy aids archaeological studies, helps unearth these traits to light. 
									Archaeoastronomers try to find what is called an alignment. 
									In short, an alignment happens when someone can observe a celestial body of interest from a specific spot of the site. </p>
									
									<p>Archaeoastronomy research in Indonesia has led to intriguing hypotheses for at least Prambanan and Borobudur. 
									Both might align with the Sun, Moon, and several stars. 
									Borobudur might also act as a giant gnomon. 
									But there remains a question whether other temples exhibit similar traits, including the last constructed ancient temples: Sukuh and Cetho.</p>

									<p>Sukuh and Cetho stand on the western slopes of Mount Lawu, constructed during the last years of the Majapahit Kingdom in the 15th century. 
									They are unique compared to older Javanese temples. 
									Their main architectural feature is a stepped terrace. 
									Each terrace follows a west-east axis, following the slope inclination. 
									The easternmost terrace, the highest for each complex, is home to the main temple building. 
									The building's unique architecture&mdash;a pyramid-like structure with a truncated top&mdash;resembles Mayan temples in the Americas.</p>

									<p>As someone interested in astronomy and history, I wondered whether the archaeastronomy approach could apply to Sukuh and Cetho.
									After all, both temples' unique architecture added to my curiosity. 
									If any alignment did occur, it might add to future understandings of each temple and ancient Javanese culture.</p>

									<p>The essence of finding an alignment is to <i>translate</i> the site's orientation/direction to past positions of celestial objects. 
									Intuitively, the first step was to acquire several bearings from each site as azimuth values--towards the main temple and several significant horizon profiles like mountain peaks. 
									Sukuh's measurement spot was in front of a tortoise stone relief in front of the main temple. 
									Cetho's was in front of the giant Garudeya stone relief on the seventh terrace. 
									Since it was Covid times, I took the measurements using aids from Google Earth satellite images.</p>

									<p>I then transformed each azimuth value into declination values using the Python programming language&mdash;this was where the astronomy part kicked in. 
									Next, I matched them with those of several important celestial bodies during the construction period of those temples. 
									These celestial bodies are the Sun, Moon, and several bright stars. 
									Correcting for stars' declination values needs considering a few factors, particularly Earth's precession and stellar movements.</p>

									<p>Knowing if certain celestial bodies were observable during and after the construction period means seeking for naked eye observation. 
									Therefore, other local factors are to account for. 
									Horizon profile, latitude, atmospheric refraction, and horizon dip are four factors that can change the apparent declination values of celestial objects.</p>

									<p>Of all the matches I found, five were quite interesting. 
									Sukuh probably shows alignments with the Sun during a zenithal passage, the Moon during minor southern lunistice, Betelguese during Orion's rise, and Bellatrix during its set.
									The first three probable alignments are towards the main temple building, while the latter is towards the entrance gate on the lowest terrace. 
									Meanwhile, Cetho appears to probably align with the Moon during the northern minor lunistice as it sets behind the temple's entrance gate.</p>

									<P>These results would be inconclusive if no cultural evidence could support them. 
									That was the case for all of them. 
									Even though other cultures paid significant attention to the Sun's zenithal passage, as the Khmer Empire showcased at Angkor Wat temple, ancient Javanese has no real supportive accounts. 
									The same goes for the Moon. Its phase was of more importance than its position. 
									Ancient Javanese used Orion to consult for farming season. Another research hypothesized Sukuh to be the home for Hindi pilgrims. 
									However, those last two ideas were not enough to justify why Sukuh would have those alignments in the first place.</p>

									<i>Calculated probability density profile for all alignments found at Sukuh Temple (blue) against other alignments appearing at random (gray).</i></span>I immediately asked myself if those alignments were just mathematical coincidences. 
									To prove it, I sought for statistical calculations. 
									I flipped my mindset to think that alignments in all directions could appear randomly. 
									Those alignments I found then could be the special&mdash;or significant&mdash;ones. 
									To achieve the desired answer, I calculated the probability of all possible alignments in all directions to appear randomly, considering the horizon profile. 
									Afterwards, I compared and calculated the found alignments' probabilities to appear as unique results.</p>
									
									<p>Using the R language and an archaeoastronomy package developed by Dr. Fabio Silva <a href="https://github.com/f-silva-archaeo/skyscapeR">here</a>, I calculated the p-value for each found alignment. 
									The result was that each temple's alignment p-values (the global p-value) did not get lower than 0.05. 
									A p-value below 0.05 (more than 95% confidence level) would mean a high chance the alignments <i>are</i> unique&mdash;the temple builders deliberately built the temple in a certain way to show the alignments. 
									Thus, the result only affirmed the question: the alignments are most likely mathematical coincidences. </p>
																	
									<p>Even though I found no alignments like those at Prambanan and Borobudur, at least, statistically, the result still supported another hypothesis. 
									Sukuh and Cetho's architecture might follow the Chthonic concept, by which mountain peaks were sacred and were the place gods dwell. 
									In hindsight, new questions pop up. 
									Why are probable alignments measured in older temples? 
									Was there a shift in cultural relationships with the skies throughout the different kingdom periods? 
									Are those in Prambanan and Borobudur even <i>true</i>?
									Answering these questions with future research will help understand the relationship between ancient Javanese culture and the skies more.</p>
